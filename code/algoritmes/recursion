Pseudo code

function get out(coordinates car, coordinates exit):
    while coordinates car != coordinates exit:
        look at coordinates between car and exit
        move car(coordinates)
  
function move car(coordinates)     
    if coordinates are free:
        move car to coordinates
    if coordinates are occupied by vehicle:
        move vehicle()
        continue
